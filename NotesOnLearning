Cpp important points come across in learning
=============================================
1. Alaways use assert to check index passed as a parameter to function of an array before using the array.
2. Subscript operator should return & reference to the value of an array why because the assignemnt operator requires
  an l value that means a memory to assign the the value. for example int arr[2]=5; writing into an array at index 2 so we
  need the address. It won't work if it is like this, if subscript operator returns value  for example arr[2]'s value is 3
  the assignment would be like this arr[2]=5; //2=5 error l value required by compiler
3.Rule: Make sure you’re not trying to call an overloaded operator[] on a pointer to an object.
4.Don’t set pointers to your objects if you don’t have to. IntList *list = new IntList;
    (*list)[2] = 3; // get our IntList object, then call overloaded operator[]
    delete list;
    
 5.Overloading operator[] to take a std::string parameter can be useful when writing certain kinds of classes, such as those that use words as indices.
Conclusion
The subscript operator is typically overloaded to provide direct access to individual elements from an array (or other similar structure) contained within a class. Because strings are often implemented as arrays of characters, operator[] is often implemented in string classes to allow the user to access a single character of the string.
