======================
sizeof the class varies depends on the type of members such as enums,static
======================
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class classsize{
enum {num=6,num2,num3,num4};// enums are const's so they are not given any size as they do not have address
static const int a=8; // static variable are not part of any class object they are common for all class objects so the size of the 
                      //object will not include the size of static variables
};
int main()
{
    classsize a;
    cout<<sizeof(a);
}

output 1
=============

class classsize{
enum {num=6,num2,num3,num4};// enums are const's so they are not given any size as they do not have address
const int a=8; 
};
int main()
{
    classsize a;
    cout<<sizeof(a);
}

output 4
